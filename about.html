            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>To keep things short, I am 24 years old who has a huge love for video games and anything tech related. After completing my undergraduate degree in 2020 from The University of Liverpool I began working in London as a recruiter. I did this for a year before returning back home to study the masters degree: "Management in the Creative and Cultural Industries" at The University of York. I have just recently passed with distinction and was awared 83% in my Dissertation: <em>"Grand Theft Auto: A Commercial, Cultural, and Creative Triumph".</em> 
            Over the last year I have developed an affinity for Front-End Development, and as a result I have used the likes of Code Academy to teach myself: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. As a result, this has allowed me to created this website alongside other projects of mine in hopes of securing a junior Front-End Developer role in the near future!</p>
